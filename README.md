# Roll20
I was having problems sharing my Codes for Roll20, so here I am once again drawn to GitHub.
This Repository contains the variety of Macros from my Campaign (Dungeon Fantasy)
You'll likely encounter HTML Code for bypassing the Parser
You might also find JavaScript Code, as the site utilizes such things.
Like most Repositories, if you encounter any problems with my Codes, post a Bug Report in the Issues section.
I'm using the MIT License because it sounded the most permissive without it holding myself liable for derivatives of my work, but I do at least ask for credit where Credit is due, some of this stuff I just kinda patchwork stitched together and forced it to function, others I might have been inspired by someone else, or it might have been their idea at some point, but I probably tried to tweak it somewhere along the line and can't guarantee that it's the same as the original.
