This is the GitHub Page for all of my Roll20 Ideas & Content.

The Macros will have some Formatting based on it's intended usage, this will vary Section to Section, but, it's got some general Guidelines.

The Following Code Table will lay out the Guidelines for the various Header segments:

```
# Yes: √
# No: X
This is the way we note if a Feature is used or not, these Lines themselves are not meant to be used in the actual Macros, this is just here so you can Copy/Paste them into the correct Fields for proper identification.

# Token Action: √ / X
Is this Macro to be flagged as a Token Action?
This is used whenever a Macro uses the prefix of "@{selected|" instead of just "@{" or "@{target|1|"

# Macro Bar: √ / X
This is to be shown on the Macro Bar, the Bar be Enabled.
This Flag is rarely used, instead favoring things such as the Chat Macros or Handouts, but this is useful for setting up such Macros.

# Chat Macro: √ / X
This denotes the Macro is a Macro sent to the Chat Window, useful for a wide variety of things, ranging from long lists of similar tasks, to 

# Handout Macro: √ / X
This denotes that it is to be called from Within a Handout, complete with the Call on the Next Line.

# Sub-Macro: √ / X
This denotes that it is supposed to be a Macro Called by another Macro.
```

You'll likely encounter HTML Code for bypassing the Parser in here,
You might also find JavaScript Code, as Roll20 utilizes such things.

Like most Repositories, if you encounter any problems with my Codes, post a Bug Report in the Issues section.

I'm using the MIT License because it sounded the most permissive without it holding myself liable for derivatives of my work, but I do at least ask for credit where Credit is due, some of this stuff I just kinda patchwork stitched together and forced it to function, others I might have been inspired by someone else, or it might have been their idea at some point, but I probably tried to tweak it somewhere along the line and can't guarantee that it's the same as the original.
