@{You} creates up to 4 Torch Sized Lights within Range, making them appear as Torches, Lanterns, or Glowing Orbs that Hover in the Air for the Duration.

@{You} can also combine the 4 Lights into 1 Glowing, vaguely Humanoid Form, of Medium Size.

Whichever Form @{You} chose, each Light sheds Dim Light in a 10-Foot Radius.
