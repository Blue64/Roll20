Deflect Missiles: (Updated)
&{template:default} {{name=Deflect Missile}} {{Starting at 3rd Level, you can use your Reaction to Deflect/Catch the Projectile when you are Hit by a Ranged Weapon Attack.

When you do so, the Damage you take from the Attack is reduced by [[1d10 +([[{[[floor((@{strength} -10) /2)]],[[floor((@{dexterity} -10) /2)]]}kh1]]) +@{base_level}]].

If you reduce the Damage to 0, you can catch the Projectile if it is small enough for you to hold in 1 Hand & you have at least 1 Hand free.

If you catch a Projectile in this way, as part of the same Reaction, you can spend 1 Ki point to make a Ranged Weapon Attack with the Projectile you just caught.

The Projectile counts as a Monk Weapon for the Attack, granting you Proficiency with this Attack, which has a Range of 20/60.}}

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a DC [[8 + @{pb} +[[floor((@{wisdom} -10) /2)]]]] Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points.
